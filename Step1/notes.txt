in order to put the build files into the build directory:
1. create a build folder
2. cd to that folder
3. run `cmake <path_to_source>` so that cmake knows where is the source code
4. run `cmkae --build .` so that the build files will be put into the build directory

No need to change dir, the build files will be put into where we are
