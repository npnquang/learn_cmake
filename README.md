This directory contains source code examples for the CMake Tutorial.
Each step has its own subdirectory containing code that may be used as a starting point. The tutorial examples are progressive so that each step
provides the complete solution for the previous step.

The purpose of learning CMake is to be able to learn ROS2.

***Note***: I have reached Step 4, which I think is sufficient to use it with ROS.
